			<h3>General Rules of Tarot</h3>
			<p>Tarot, a historic and strategic card game originating from France, stands out with its unique rules and captivating gameplay. Typically played with four players, this game combines strategy, chance, and skill, offering a rich and varied experience.</p>

			<h4>Requirements to Start Tarot</h4>
			<p>Tarot is played with a special deck of 78 cards, divided between traditional cards and trumps. It can be played with three, four, or five players, each configuration offering a slightly different experience.</p>

			<h4>Card Distribution</h4>
			<p>The deck consists of 56 traditional cards, ranging from Ace to King, with an additional card, the Knight, placed between the Jack and Queen. Additionally, there are 21 trumps numbered 1 to 21, used to cut other suits, and the Excuse, acting as a joker.</p>

			<h4>Objective of the Game</h4>
			<p>The main goal is to accumulate as many points as possible. This is achieved through successive bids, where the player, aided by the Oudlers, aims to reach a specific score to win the bid.</p>

			<h4>The Oudlers and Their Importance</h4>
			<p>The three Oudlers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The 21.</li>
				<li>The 1 (also called "Le Petit").</li>
				<li>The Excuse.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are key cards. Each Oudler adds 5 points to the playerâ€™s score, altering the required points to win.</p>

			<h4>Starting a Tarot Game</h4>
			<p>The game begins with cards being dealt three at a time and the formation of a "dog" of six cards. The player with the lowest card starts dealing.</p>

			<h4>Bids and Auctions</h4>
			<p>Players bet on their potential gains at different levels of bids, ranging from a simple Take to a Guard Against the Dog, each level modifying the score multiplier for victory or defeat.</p>

			<h4>Gameplay</h4>
			<p>After the bids, the taker reveals the dog and incorporates six cards of their choice. Opponents form a team against the taker. The game proceeds with specific rules for trumps and the Excuse.</p>

			<h4>Point Counting</h4>
			<p>Point counting is crucial. Cards have different values, and the total must reach 91 points. The taker must achieve a specific score based on the number of Oudlers in their possession.</p>

			<h4>Special Actions</h4>
			<p>The game includes special actions such as the Petit au Bout, the Grand Slam, and the Small Slam, offering additional strategic opportunities.</p>

			<p>This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Tarot rules, from prerequisites to advanced strategies and point counting. Each Tarot game is a unique strategic adventure, where every decision can influence the final outcome.</p>

			<h3>Rules of Tarot for 4 Players</h3>
			<p>The game of Tarot, known for its strategic and dynamic gameplay, is a classic French card game. Dating back to the 16th century, it is primarily played with four players, though it can also be played with three or five. The goal is to accumulate the highest number of points. This guide presents the Tarot cards and rules for four players.</p>

			<h4>Composition of the Deck</h4>
			<p>Tarot is played with 78 cards:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>56 traditional suit cards (Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts), each consisting of 14 cards from Ace to King.</li>
				<li>21 Trumps, numbered and stronger than suits. The higher the number, the stronger the trump.</li>
				<li>The Fool, marked with a star, acts as a joker.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The key cards in the game are the Oulders or Bouts (1, 21, and the Fool).</p>

			<h4>Card Values</h4>
			<p>Knowing the value of the cards is essential:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1 Oudler (1, 21, Fool) = 5 points</li>
				<li>1 King = 5 points</li>
				<li>1 Queen = 4 points</li>
				<li>1 Knight = 3 points</li>
				<li>1 Jack = 2 points</li>
				<li>Other cards = 0.5 points</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Low cards are counted in pairs.</p>

			<h4>Objective of the Game</h4>
			<p>The goal for the "taker" is to score a set number of points, helped by the Oulders (Trump 21, Trump 1, and the Fool). Each Oudler is worth 5 points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Without any Oudler, 56 points are needed.</li>
				<li>With 1 Oudler, 51 points are needed.</li>
				<li>With 2 Oulders, 41 points are enough.</li>
				<li>With 3 Oulders, only 36 points are required.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Gameplay</h4>
			<p>Cards are dealt in sets of three after selecting the dealer. The "chien" (dog) is a set of 6 cards set aside. If a player decides to take, they add these cards to their hand, replacing 6 cards of their choice, except Kings and Oulders.</p>

			<h4>The Bids</h4>
			<p>The player who takes makes a bid, influencing the points won or lost:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Petite:</strong> 25 points.</li>
				<li><strong>Garde:</strong> doubles the points.</li>
				<li><strong>Garde without the chien:</strong> quadruples the points.</li>
				<li><strong>Garde against the chien:</strong> sextuples the points.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Playing a Round</h4>
			<p>The game starts to the left of the dealer. Players must follow the suit played if possible. Otherwise, they may trump with a trump card. The Fool can be played to avoid losing a trick but has no inherent value and does not win tricks. It is returned at the end of the round.</p>

			<h4>End of the Game</h4>
			<p>The game ends when all cards have been played. Points are then tallied to determine the winner.</p>

			<p>Tarot is a fascinating game blending strategy and thought. Learn and practice these rules for four players to enjoy an enriching gaming experience.</p>

			<h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Deck of 78 cards:</strong> Includes 56 traditional cards, 21 Trumps, and the Fool as a joker.</li>
				<li><strong>Key Oulders:</strong> 1, 21, and the Fool, essential for scoring points.</li>
				<li><strong>Card Values:</strong> Oulders and Kings = 5 points, Queens = 4, Knights = 3, Jacks = 2, others = 0.5.</li>
				<li><strong>Taker's Goal:</strong> Score a minimum number of points depending on the number of Oulders in hand.</li>
				<li><strong>Strategy and Points:</strong> Without any Oudler, 56 points are required; with 3 Oulders, only 36 points are needed.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Rules of Tarot for 5 Players</h3>

			<p>The game of Tarot, known for its strategic and dynamic gameplay, is a classic French card game. Dating back to the 16th century, it is primarily played with four players, though it can also be played with three or five. The goal is to accumulate the highest number of points. This guide presents the Tarot cards and rules for five players.</p>

			<h4>Composition of the Deck</h4>
			<p>Tarot is played with 78 cards:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>56 traditional suit cards (Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts), each consisting of 14 cards from Ace to King.</li>
				<li>21 Trumps, numbered and stronger than suits. The higher the number, the stronger the trump.</li>
				<li>The Fool, marked with a star, acts as a joker.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The key cards in the game are the Oulders or Bouts (1, 21, and the Fool).</p>

			<h4>Card Values</h4>
			<p>Knowing the value of the cards is essential:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1 Oudler (1, 21, Fool) = 5 points</li>
				<li>1 King = 5 points</li>
				<li>1 Queen = 4 points</li>
				<li>1 Knight = 3 points</li>
				<li>1 Jack = 2 points</li>
				<li>Other cards = 0.5 points</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Low cards are counted in pairs.</p>

			<h4>Objective of the Game</h4>
			<p>The game for five players aims to win as many tricks as possible. One player, the "taker," faces four opponents, the "defense." The taker must accumulate points based on the number of Oulders held. The required points vary depending on the Oulders in hand:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Without any Oudler, 56 points are needed.</li>
				<li>With 1 Oudler, 51 points are needed.</li>
				<li>With 2 Oulders, 41 points are enough.</li>
				<li>With 3 Oulders, only 36 points are required.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Fool and Trump 21 are typically loyal to the taker, but care must be taken when using the Fool in the final trick.</p>

			<h4>Dealing the Cards</h4>
			<p>The dealer is chosen randomly. After spreading the cards face down, each player draws one to designate the dealer. The dealer deals the cards in sets of three, also forming a "chien" (dog) of 3 cards. A misdeal requires a redistribution of the cards.</p>

			<h4>The Bidding</h4>
			<p>After dealing, players evaluate their hands. The bidding begins to the right of the dealer, with each player having the option to outbid the previous bid. The declarer must choose a King (or a Queen, or a Knight depending on their cards) before revealing the "chien." The player holding the chosen King becomes the taker's partner.</p>

			<h4>Announcements and Point Distribution</h4>
			<p>Players can announce a "handful" of trumps for additional points. Points are distributed based on the success or failure of the bid, proportionally between the taker and their partner. If the taker plays alone, they claim all the points in case of victory.</p>

			<h4>End of the Game</h4>
			<p>The game ends when all cards have been played. Points are then tallied to determine the winner.</p>

			<p>Tarot is a fascinating game blending strategy and thought. Learn and practice these rules for five players to enjoy an enriching gaming experience.</p>

			<h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Composition:</strong> 78 cards, including 56 traditional cards, 21 Trumps, and the Fool as a joker.</li>
				<li><strong>Card Values:</strong> Importance of Oulders (1, 21, Fool) and the hierarchy of cards for scoring.</li>
				<li><strong>Objective for Five:</strong> A "taker" versus four in "defense," with a points goal based on Oulders held.</li>
				<li><strong>Dealing and Bidding:</strong> Dealer determined by drawing lots, and bidding to define the taker and their potential partner.</li>
				<li><strong>End of the Game:</strong> Points are tallied after all cards are played to determine the winner.</li>
			</ul>
