    <h2>Discover More About Tarot Rules</h2>
    <p>Tarot is more than just a card game; it’s a strategic challenge that combines skill, calculation, and the thrill of competition. From its unique scoring system to special actions like the Grand Slam, Tarot offers an immersive experience that rewards mastery and creativity.</p>

    <h3>Scoring in Tarot</h3>
    <h4>Card Values in Tarot</h4>
    <p>Tarot is unique for its fractional scoring system, where every card has a specific value:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bouts (Trump 1, Trump 21, and the Fool)</strong> and Kings: 4.5 points</li>
        <li><strong>Queens:</strong> 3.5 points</li>
        <li><strong>Knights:</strong> 2.5 points</li>
        <li><strong>Jacks:</strong> 1.5 points</li>
        <li><strong>Minor cards:</strong> 0.5 points each</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To simplify scoring, pair high-value cards with minor cards to form whole numbers (e.g., a King with a minor card equals 5 points).</p>

    <h4>Points Needed to Win a Contract</h4>
    <p>The challenge in Tarot lies in fulfilling the contract, not just in winning tricks. The points required depend on the number of Bouts held:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With 0 Bouts:</strong> 56 points are required.</li>
        <li><strong>With 1 Bout:</strong> 51 points are needed.</li>
        <li><strong>With 2 Bouts:</strong> 41 points suffice.</li>
        <li><strong>With 3 Bouts:</strong> Only 36 points are required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Special Bonuses for Announcements</h4>
    <p>Players can earn extra points for declaring a "Poignée" (handful of trumps):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple Poignée (10 Trumps):</strong> 20 points</li>
        <li><strong>Double Poignée (13 Trumps):</strong> 30 points</li>
        <li><strong>Triple Poignée (15 Trumps):</strong> 40 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These bonuses apply to the winning side of the hand, adding a strategic layer to gameplay.</p>

    <h3>Special Actions in Tarot</h3>
    <h4>The Petit au Bout</h4>
    <p>The Petit (Trump 1) earns 10 bonus points if it is played in the final trick without being lost. This bonus is multiplied based on the contract level, making it a key element of strategic play.</p>

    <h4>The Grand Slam</h4>
    <p>The Grand Slam, a bold declaration to win all tricks, offers high rewards:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Announced and achieved:</strong> 400 points</li>
        <li><strong>Unannounced but achieved:</strong> 200 points</li>
        <li><strong>Announced but not achieved:</strong> -200 points</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Small Slam</h4>
    <p>The Small Slam is achieved when the taker concedes only one trick. This rare feat rewards near-perfection and adds depth to the game.</p>

    <h3>Definition and Role of Trumps</h3>
    <h4>What Are Trumps?</h4>
    <p>Trumps are a series of 21 cards, numbered I to XXI, that are stronger than any suit card. The Fool, an unnumbered card, acts as a joker, providing strategic opportunities to avoid losing tricks.</p>

    <h4>Strategic Use of Trumps</h4>
    <p>Trumps allow players to "cut" and win tricks even when they don’t hold the required suit. This ability introduces unpredictability and opens the door to dramatic turnarounds during gameplay.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Tarot is a game that combines history, strategy, and excitement. With its distinctive scoring and dynamic gameplay, it continues to be a favorite for casual players and competitive enthusiasts alike. Master the rules, embrace the strategies, and enjoy the timeless thrill of Tarot.</p>
